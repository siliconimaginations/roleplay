## Stage 0 — Foundation & Tooling ✅

Repo live, CI running, local dev works.

- GitHub repo + branch conventions (main requires PR + CI green)
- Python 3.12 + uv package manager + pyproject.toml
- Package skeleton: `src/roleplay/` + `tests/` + smoke tests pass
- GitHub Actions CI: 2 parallel jobs — `lint` (ruff + mypy), `test` (pytest + coverage)
- Coverage threshold: 60% overall / 70% changed-files; badge auto-committed on push to main
- Gemini AI code review on every PR; blocks merge on 🔴 Critical / 🟠 Major issues
- `ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md`: shared process rules for all contributors

| Submodule | PRs | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| `Party` dataclass (person, organization, environment) | #11, #14 | Persona, mutable state, history |
| `Environment` party + state schema | #11, #14 | Physical + context tracking |

---

## Stage 4 — Simulation Engine ✅

| `ObserverHook` + `ObserverDirective` | #16 | Continue / halt / inject |
| `_assemble_prompt` (6-layer structure) | #16 | Budget trimming, history, memory, persona |
| Environment reactive turn | #16 | Env party updates state per episode |
| `ProviderExhaustedError` catch + graceful halt | #51 | Session summary still prints on exhaust |

---

## Stage 5 — LLM Provider Layer ✅

`src/roleplay/providers/`

| Submodule | PRs | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| `Provider` protocol + `CompletionRequest/Response` | #17 | Typed interface |
| `GeminiProvider` — model fallback chain | #17, #24, #26–28, #51, #56 | 6-model chain; Gemma 4 fallback |
| `ClaudeProvider` | #17 | Anthropic SDK adapter |
| `MockProvider` | #17 | Scripted responses; no API key |
| Session-level rate-limit skip list | #24 | Exhausted models skipped for session lifetime |

| httpx timeout → `ProviderError` | #35 | ReadTimeout + ConnectTimeout caught |
| `ProviderRegistry` | #17 | Config-driven provider selection |

---

## POC Scenario Runner ✅ — `src/roleplay/poc.py`

The primary user-facing entry point until Stage 7 CLI is built.

```
uv run python -m roleplay.poc [OPTIONS]
```

| Feature | PR | Notes |
|---------|----|-------|
| TOML scenario loading via `config.py` | #19 | `--config`, `--env-file` flags |
| `.env` API key loading | #19 | Silently ignored if missing |
| Mock provider (`--mock`) | #17 | No API key; scripted responses |
| Verbosity 0: AI episode summaries | #29, #36 | One line per episode + env diff |
| Verbosity 1: full dialog stream | #25 | Default; each turn printed in real time |
| Verbosity 2: turn excerpts + AI summary | #57 | 80-char excerpt per turn + AI summary |
| Episode counter `N / M` in header | #47 | Shows progress through total episode count |
| Per-episode wall-clock timing `⏱` | #47 | Displayed after each episode |
| Model-switch notice `⚡` | #47 | Shown when fallback model is used |
| Goal tally `(goal achieved N / M ep)` | #47 | Running tally on ⊙ goal line |
| Session summary (models, tokens, duration) | #47 | Printed after `engine.run()` returns |
| Final env state snapshot | #47 | Printed in verbosity=0 mode |
| Checkpoint resume | #57 | `.checkpoint.json` survives crashes (closes #46) |
| `--watch` spinner | #57 | Dots to stderr during slow LLM calls (closes #45) |
| TOML validator CLI | #23 | `python -m roleplay.validate scenarios/x.toml` |
| Scenario format docs | #23, #53 | `docs/scenario-format.md`; AI-generation tips |

---

## Stage 6 — Persistence & Session 🔲

Implement `src/roleplay/persistence/`.

Prerequisite for `roleplay resume`, `roleplay fork`, and `roleplay inspect`.

| Submodule | Design Doc | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| SQLite schema + migrations | `07-persistence.md` | Sessions, episodes, turns, memory entries |
| `SqlitePersistenceLayer` | `07-persistence.md` | Create, save, load, list, delete |
| Session save / resume | `07-persistence.md` | Full state round-trip across process restarts |
| Memory persistence | `07-persistence.md` | Durable store (replaces `InMemoryStore`) |
| Session fork / branching | `07-persistence.md` | `parent_session_id` + `forked_at_episode` |
| JSON export | `07-persistence.md` | For analysis and downstream tools |

Exit criteria: Session save/resume round-trips correctly; memory survives process restart; ≥ 80% coverage.

---

## Stage 7 — CLI UI 🔲

Implement the full `roleplay` CLI described in `docs/engineering/08-cli.md`.

Note: `poc.py` already covers the core `roleplay run` use case; Stage 7 adds persistence-backed commands, the YAML scenario format, and interactive pause mode.

| Submodule | Design Doc | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `roleplay run <scenario.yaml>` | `08-cli.md` | YAML loader; stream output to terminal |
| `roleplay resume <session_id>` | `08-cli.md` | Load from SQLite and continue |
| `roleplay inspect <session_id>` | `08-cli.md` | Dump party state, memory, episode log |
| `roleplay list` | `08-cli.md` | All sessions in DB |
| `roleplay fork <session_id>` | `08-cli.md` | Branch a session at current state |
| `roleplay forget` / `roleplay delete` | `08-cli.md` | Memory + session management |
| Interactive pause mode | `08-cli.md` | `p` to pause; inject / state / persona / memory commands |

Exit criteria: Both example scenarios runnable from CLI with real LLMs; resume tested after simulated crash.

---

## Stage 8 — REST API 🔲

Expose the simulator as a service.

| Submodule | Design Doc | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| FastAPI app skeleton | `09-api.md` | Health, session CRUD |
| Simulation control endpoints | `09-api.md` | Start, pause, step, resume |
| WebSocket live updates | `09-api.md` | Stream episode turns to client |
| Auth (API key) | `09-api.md` | Simple key auth for self-hosted use |

---

## Stage 9 — Hardening & CI/CD Maturity 🔲

| Submodule | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Integration test suite | Full episode run with real LLMs; tagged `integration` |
| Performance profiling | Episode loop latency; memory retrieval under load |
| Coverage promotion | All targets raised 5 pp |
| Docker image | Single-container deployment |
| Cloud deploy guide | Docker Compose → cloud-ready config |
